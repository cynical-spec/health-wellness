# Status — Sehat Saathi
*Last updated: 2026-05-10 — Session 9 (v4 — Tier 2/3 reframe: symptoms-first, recipe-steps, live voice)*

## Session 9 highlights
- **Hub re-anchored on symptoms triage** — 8-button `tri-grid` (Sir dard, Sardi-khansi, Pet, Neend, Ghutno, Bukhar, Tension, Saans/galay) is now the primary path. Mood is collapsed into a single-line pulse-check strip. Other use cases (Story, Saans, Lab, Dawai, Meal, Parivaar) live in a subtle `tri-rail`.
- **Ghar-ka-nushka now ends in an animation, not a YouTube link** — `REMEDY_KITS` (15 recipes) + `injectRemedyCard()` produce an in-app step overlay (reuses `move-ov`) with ingredients, step-by-step, auto-advance, Sarvam TTS read-aloud, progress dots.
- **Acupressure cards** — `ACUPRESSURE_POINTS` (6 points) with SVG body silhouettes + pulsing pin marker; keyword-triggered from AI replies.
- **Voice = real conversation** — live mic-level bars (driven from analyser RMS), state pill, live transcript area (`Aap ne kaha:` + `Saathi:`), thinking line, mirrored bot replies. Works on both hub-target and chat-target Speak.

## Session 8 highlights
- **Sehat hub fully redesigned** as 3-zone home (greeting / 3 moods / story+score). Tools moved to bottom-sheet behind 3-dot menu.
- **Voice migrated to Sarvam** — Saarika STT + Bulbul TTS, all Indian languages, persona-mapped speakers (pavithra/meera/amol).
- **Dynamic story generation** per persona+season+language via OpenAI → played through Sarvam TTS.
- **Sehat Score persisted** with 4 levels (Shishya→Rakshak→Mitra→Guru), daily dots (paani/swas/khana), streak tracking, Ritucharya unlock at 91+.
- **Meal Planning** now respects household chronic conditions in the system prompt.
- **Visual tokens v3**: `#0a0a0a` bg, `#6B21A8` purple, `#fb923c` amber, no gradients, no drop shadows.

⚠️ **Required secret**: `SARVAM_KEY` must be set in GitHub Secrets before voice works.

## Known Limitations
1. **OpenAI may be blocked** on some Indian ISPs — Groq handles non-Vision calls; **Lab Interpreter has no Groq fallback** (Vision-only)
2. **setTimeout reminders** don't fire if tab is closed
3. **Voice: Chrome/Safari only** — Firefox hides Speak button
4. **Web Speech voice quality varies** — iOS Safari has limited Indian language voices; Bhashini swap recommended for production (DEC-009)
5. **File is ~4569 lines** — well past 800-line ideal (DEC-009, accepted for prototype)
6. **Lab Vision spend** — ~$0.01–0.03 per report; capped at 5 pages
7. **Nushke recipes are now in-app** (Session 9) — old YouTube fallback removed in favor of step overlays. AYUSH ingredients without a kit (rare) get no card.
8. **Sarvam STT is post-recording**, not streaming — voice overlay's "live" feel comes from mic-level bars + transcript-on-arrival, not partial words. If/when Sarvam ships streaming, swap in `convListenOnce()`.
9. **Community peers** are AI roleplay only — no real users; required disclaimer enforces honesty
10. **Orphan CSS** — `.hub3-mood*`/`.hub3-carousel*`/`.hub3-qb*` rules remain (no DOM uses them); slated for cleanup next session.
